# calc_in_asm
little learning of assembly langague on linux using 64 bits register

it's just a basic calculator so if the result is greater than 9 it will not display it.

I will upgrade it later. :)

if you don't know how to compile asm, you can use the file compil_calc as :

./compil_calc

Prerequisite :

-nasm

-ld
